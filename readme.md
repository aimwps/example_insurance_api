# EXAMPLE INSURANCE API

This api is called to retrieve data that can be used for machine learning algorithms in the insurance_ml application.
The repo for that repository can be found here https://github.com/aimwps/example_insurance_ml


## THE DATA
As this is a quick example I will use a single and limited dataset to predict insurance premium costs based on user data. In a production
environment there will be far greater complexities to the data being stored, and therefore how it can be utilised.
