#EXAMPLE INSURANCE API

This api is called to retrieve data that can be used for machine learning algorithms in the insurance_ml application.
It is an example of how to create a product based on the guidelines of a client. It is an example of how one could call
an api and through a bespoke web application use the recieved data to perform ML tasks on insurance data.


# THE DATA
As this is a quick example I will use a single and limited dataset to predict insurance premium costs based on user data. In a production
environment there will be far greater complexities to the data being stored, and therefore how it can be utilised.

# THE CLIENT
The client has good knowledge of software development and insurance industries. They have articulated exactly what is expected from each
part of the project. In essence, the client wrote the project in psuedo code first and it is my task to return a completed application.

# BASE INSTRUCTIONS
Each section of the application will be planned out in pseudo code first. The two key objectives are as follows.
  # Build an example api that holds insurance data (This repository)
  # Build a seperate application that retrieves data to train an ML model to predict an insurance premium, allowing a user to predict their premium.
